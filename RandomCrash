Ques:
Random crashes â€“ you are given a source code to test and it randomly crashes and it never crashes in the same place 
( you have attached a debugger and you find this). Explain what all you would suspect and how would you go about with isolating the cause. 

Ans:
 I will try check or Identify any specific actions or conditions that trigger the crash.
 do code review  paying attention to memory allocation/deallocation, pointer usage, and concurrency issues.
Implement continuous monitoring tools to capture runtime behavior, even in production, to gather additional insights.
