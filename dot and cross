Ques:
What is dot product and cross product? Explain use cases of where dot product is used and cross product 
is used in graphics environment. Add links to places where you studied this information and get back with the understanding. 

Ans:
The cross product is mostly used to determine the vector, which is perpendicular to the plane surface spanned by two vectors, 
whereas the dot product is used to find the angle between two vectors or the length of the vector.
The cross product of two vectors, say A × B, is equal to another vector at right angles to both, and it happens in the three dimensions.

->Ray-Plane Intersection:
A plane is defined by the equation: Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, or the vector [A B C D]. A, B, and C, define the normal to the plane. If A2 + B2 + C2 = 1 then the unit normal Pn = [A B C]. If A, B, and C define a unit normal, then the distance from the origin [0 0 0] to the plane is D.

A ray is defined by: R0 = [X0, Y0, Z0]

Rd = [Xd, Yd, Zd]

so R(t) = R0 + t * Rd , t > 0

To determine if there is an intersection with the plane, substitute for R(t) into the plane equation and get:

A(X0 + Xd * t) + B(Y0 + Yd * t) + (Z0 + Zd * t) + D = 0

which yields:

t = -(AX0 + BY0 + CZ0 + D) / (AXd + BYd + CZd)

= -(Pn· R0 + D) / (Pn · Rd)
